Quantum Information and Optimization (QIOP) workshop (量子信息与优化研讨会) focuses on the intersection of quantum information and optimization theory, two rapidly advancing fields with transformative potential. 

This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together experts to explore cutting-edge research on topics such as optimization in quantum information theory, quantum error correction, quantum circuit design, quantum algorithms for optimization, and optimization of quantum systems. By bridging these fields, the workshop seeks to advance theoretical foundations, develop innovative algorithms, and address large-scale real-world problems. 



## Location

The workshop will take place at TIANYUAN Center ([天元数学国际交流中心](http://tianyuan.amss.ac.cn/)), Yiliang, Kunming, Yunnan.
