Quantum Information and Optimization (QIOP) workshop (量子信息与优化研讨会) focuses on the intersection of quantum information and optimization theory, two rapidly advancing fields with transformative potential. 
This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together experts to explore cutting-edge research on topics such as 
- optimization in quantum information theory
- optimization in quantum machine learning
- quantum circuit design, optimization, error correction 
- quantum algorithms for optimization problems
- optimization of quantum systems
- hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods. 

By providing a platform for experts to share their knowledge and insights, the workshop seeks to advance the theoretical foundations of quantum information, address significant challenges, and develop innovative algorithms that leverage the power of both fields.


## Location

The workshop will take place at TIANYUAN Center ([天元数学国际交流中心](http://tianyuan.amss.ac.cn/)), Yiliang (宜良), Kunming, Yunnan.
