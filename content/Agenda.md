April 13, Sunday
-------------

Welcome Potluck Barbeque at Bruce's House (107 WhiteRock). Bring something to
grill, cook, or share. There will be food, so if you're just getting into town
and don't have time, or you're hopeless in the kitchen, just bring your
favorite beverage.

Go to the corner of First and WhiteRock, and you'll see a building of four
townhomes with solar panels on the roof. My unit is the furthest away from
the corner, and you'll see a little white cargo trailer in front. I usually
have colorful lights on, as well.
